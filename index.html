        <h4>Portfolio Goals</h4>
        <p>Alex's goal is to create an interactive website called itinerator that gives out-of-towners the ability to maximize their enjoyment during a stay in Boulder, CO. Users can specify a time frame that they have available to stay, different types of activities, and a type of cuisine.
        The application will return an optimized itinerary of events, along with a description of each event, directions, and a map.</p>

        <h4>About Boulder</h4>
        <p>On November 7, 1861, legislation was passed making way for the state university to be located in Boulder, and on September 20, 1875, the first cornerstone was laid for the first building (Old Main Building) on the CU campus. The university officially
          opened on September 5, 1877. Boulder adopted an anti-saloon ordinance in 1907.[16] Statewide prohibition started in Colorado in 1916[17] and ended with the repeal of national prohibition in 1933.</p>
          <br><img src="Boulder.jpg" width=100%>
          <br> <br><p>The city of Boulder is in Boulder Valley where the Rocky Mountains meet the Great Plains. West of the city are slabs of sedimentary stone tilted up on the foothills, known as the Flatirons. The Flatirons are a widely recognized symbol
          of Boulder.[23] The primary water flow through the city is Boulder Creek. The creek was named well ahead of the city's founding, for all of the large granite boulders that have cascaded into the creek over the eons. It is from Boulder Creek
          that Boulder city is believed to have taken its name. Boulder Creek has significant water flow, derived primarily from snow melt and minor springs west of the city. The creek is a tributary of the South Platte River.</p>
